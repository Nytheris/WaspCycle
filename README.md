# WaspCycle
A program for speedrunners to see the position of wasp cameras in The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run.

For PC players it should always stay in sync without any need for adjustments.

Console players will need to line the animation up by adjusting the offset with the left and right arrow keys (Hold shift for bigger changes). 
The down arrow key will reset the offset.

(This information is also available by pressing H with the program open).
